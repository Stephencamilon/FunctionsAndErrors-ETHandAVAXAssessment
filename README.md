# Exception Handling Smart Contract


## Description
This Solidity smart contract showcases the usage of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for exception handling respectively.


### Contract Details
1. The require() statement checks if the amount is greater than zero.

2. The assert() checks the addition of the amount so that it would not cause any cash or transaction overflows.

3. revert() checks if the amount is equal to 42. If so, it will prompt and say "cannot deposit the number 42".
